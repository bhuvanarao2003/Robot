# 🤖 Robot Framework Automation Projects

This repository contains a variety of automation scripts built using **Robot Framework** and **RPA Framework**. The goal of these projects is to demonstrate how real-world tasks can be automated using easy-to-understand, keyword-driven code.

These automation workflows include desktop app interactions, file operations, and web-based tasks — all handled using open-source RPA tools.
